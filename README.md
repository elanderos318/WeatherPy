**Observable Trends**

There does not appear to be a strong relationship between latitude and humidity. However, the data appears to bundle from approx. 70% to the max of 100%. Likewise for latitude vs wind speed: no strong relationship is observed, but a high percentage of the data sits between 0% and approx. 12% wind speed.

No correlation exists between latitude and cloudiness from observation of this graph. We do see bands of data at certain levels of cloudiness such as at 0%, 20%, 40%, and 90%. This may be more of an indication of how the data is collected and recorded.

We do in fact see a relationship between latitude and temperature. As we might expect, temperature is lower for low and high latitudes, and it increases for latitudes which approach 0. Though not a surprise, we do see outliers, such as a few at latitude = - which drop below the 60 degrees mark.
